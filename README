RTP Tools

Description

The rtptools distribution consists of a number of small applications that
can be used for processing RTP data.

rtpplay
     play back RTP sessions recorded by rtpdump
rtpsend
     generate RTP packets from textual description, generated by hand or
     rtpdump
rtpdump
     parse and print RTP packets, generating output files suitable for
     rtpplay and rtpsend
rtptrans
     RTP translator between unicast and multicast networks

multidump
	 Shell script that starts multiple rtpdump's simultaneously.  If you
	 want to play the recording with multiplay, use the '-F dump'
	 option. Writes to base-file.N (N = 1,2,...).
     Usage: 
       multidump <args for rtpdump> base-file addr/port addr/port ...

multiplay
	 Shell script that starts multiple rtpplay's simultaneously.
     Usage: 
       multiplay <args for rtpplay> base-file addr/port addr/port ...

Installation

The RTP tools should compile on any Posix-compliant platform supporting
sockets as well as on Windows NT/Win32. For Unix systems, type

./configure; make

To install RTP tools on NT machine, please follow the following steps:

*.dsp files are project files. *.dsw file and workspace file. 
User can open the workspace file and use 'batch compile' to compile all
the projects.

1. In Visual C++ 5.0/6.0, open workspace file rtptools.dsw

2. In VC menu Tools -- Options, change the include directory, add
   the following directories to the include directory:
   <...>\rtptools-1.14       (rtptools source code directory)
   <...>\rtptools-1.14\nt\include
   <...>\rtptools-1.14\nt\include\utilnt

3. In VC menu Build, use Batch Build to build all the tools
