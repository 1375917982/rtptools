<h1><a href="rtptools.html">RTP tools</a> change history</h1>

<dl>
<dt>1.11 (January 1999)
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Marc Eaddy found that MSVC++ 5.0 only works if seq is declared
unsigned int seq:16.

<li>Additional Linux fixes by <a href="mailto:pere@hungry.com"> Petter
Reinholdtsen</a>

<li>Windows NT/Win32 port by Xiaotao Wu (Columbia University).

</ul>

<dt>1.10 (March 1998)
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Bill Fenner:  "I've been experimenting with real short clips, and
discovered that rtpplay exited as soon as it read the last packet
instead of letting the playout happen, cutting off READAHEAD packets
(which in most cases was the whole file).  Here are my fixes.  Note that
I had to (somewhat kludgily) schedule another timeout, since the notify
system doesn't notice a notify_stop() request which is set from a
timeout until there's another event." [hgs:  Notify was changed to drop
out when there are no pending timers and no open file descriptors.]

<li>Jonathan Lennox created <tt>multidump</tt> and <tt>multiplay</tt>.

<li>Catch additional signals.

<li>rtpplay: Add <tt>-b</tt> and <tt>-e</tt> flags for playing back only
a selected portion of the file.

<li>rtpplay: The first RTP packet is now timed correctly with respect to
the preceding RTCP packet.
</ul>

<dt>1.9 (August 1997)
<dd>
<ul>
<li><tt>rtptrans</tt> also has non-sendmsg ifdef for Linux and similarly
socket-challenged systems (by <a href="mailto:Lutz Grueneberg 
<gruen@rvs.uni-hannover.de>">Lutz Grueneberg</a>)

<li>Port to FreeBSD (by <a href="mailto:Jonathan Lennox 
<lennox@cs.columbia.edu>">Jonathan Lennox</a>):

<ul>
<li>Added necessary architecture Makefile.
<li>Extracted hsearch code from GNU libc 2.0.4 for rtpplay.
<li>Massive byte-ordering cleanup (behavior under FreeBSD and Solaris should
be identical).
<li>Minor other changes for BSD 4.4 sockets.
</ul>
<li><code>rtpdump -f</code> <var>file</var> now shows a "from" address of
0.0.0.0:0.
<li>Updated rtpdump, rtpplay's payload type maps to reflect current IANA
numbers.
</ul>

<dt>1.8 (July 1997)
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Bug in parsing of RR fixed.
</ul>

<dt>1.6 (October 1996)
<dd>

<ul>
<li>Format flag on <code>rtpdump</code> changed from <code>-f</code>
to <code>-F</code> for consistency.

<li>Added ability to use RTP timestamps rather than received timing
for rtpplay, making it more useful for recording.

<li>rtpdump can read from files.

<li><code>-x</code> flag supported for dump format so that only
RTP/RTCP and media headers are logged.

<li>Fixed: random address information in header.
</ul>

<dt>1.0 (December 1995)

<dd>
<ul>
<li>First independent release of rtptools.

<li>Added rtptools/rtpsend to generate arbitrary RTP packets based on
text file.  Intended as a debugging and torture/compliance test
tool.  rtpsend reads files produced by rtpdump (ASCII mode).  For
replaying recordings, use rtpplay.  Only supports RTP data and SDES
RTCP packets right now.

</ul>
